# Portfolio_ML

In this portfolio I keep some of my **machine learning projects** in which I cover all the key points of a data science project. Some of the common aspects of the projects are:
  - *Data import*: both common data sets and data collection from websites such as NASA.
  - *Data cleaning*: removing null values, duplicates and completing data using scraping.
  - *Exploratory data analysis*.
  - *Data engineering*: creating new data from data to make the model more robust.
  - *Comparison of different models*: to highlight strengths and weaknesses of each one.
  - *Data visualization*: both correlation between features and visualization of results.

Regarding the particular themes of each project, in summary:

- **Time forecast of temperatures in Avalon Beach**: from data collected from the NASA website, we obtain the time series of average temperatures per day in the well-known Avalon area in Sydney. In this project we compare the performance of basic regression models with advanced time series models such as SARIMA.

-**Movie recommendation systems**: development of recommendation systems, both collaborative and content-based. In this project we can highlight the creation of new features to improve the system, the collection of missing data using scraping and the customization of the models.

-**Study of Neural Networks**: from simpler neural networks to convolutional neural networks for image recognition and recurrent neural networks for time series.

This portfolio is **only a part of my work** that corresponds to the area of ​​machine learning and also does not include all my projects in this area.
